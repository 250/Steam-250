    <p>
        Top 250 best Steam {{ mode_c }}s of all time according to gamer reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ranking is designed to highlight {{ mode }}s consistently releasing good games on Steam.
        {{ mode_c }}s are ranked across all games, excluding DLC and discontinued titles.
        The game shown next to each {{ mode }} is the one they are most well known for, based on gamer reviews.
        {% if mode == 'developer' %}
        A small preference is given to developers with more games such that those near the top of the
        ranking typically have more than one release.
        {% else %}
        A moderate preference is given to publishers with more games such that those near the top of the
        ranking typically have at least 10 releases.
