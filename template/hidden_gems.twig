        Top 250 highly rated games that few know but many love.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ranking is the only one using the
        <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">Wilson score</a>
        to rank games. The current weightings heavily favour games with a high approval rating.
        Games near the top of the list will typically have as close to a 100% approval rating as possible.
        However, the score is negatively augmented by the number of people who have played the game.
        Once a game becomes too popular, its high player count will eventually sink the game off the list.
        However, if it has has maintained its approval rating during its growth, it will typically reappear
        on one of the other rankings, such as the <a href="/">Top 250</a>, before this happens.

    <p class="note">
        To make this list more useful we have chosen to exclude visual novels for the time being,
        because many are not available in English. Once we have a solution for language filtering,
        visual novels will return to this list. In the meantime, check out the dedicated
        <a href="/tag/visual_novel.html">visual novel ranking</a>. Thank you for your patience.
