    <p>
        Top 250 highly rated Steam games that few know but many love.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ranking favours games with a high approval rating.
        Games ranked at the top will typically have an approval rating as close to 100% as possible,
        but the score is negatively affected by the number of reviews: once a game becomes too popular,
        its high review count will eventually sink it off the list.
        However, when a game maintains a high approval rating during its growth,
        it typically reappears on another ranking such as the
        <a href="/top250{{ ext }}">Steam Top 250</a>, before the decay starts.

    <p class="tip">
        Visual novels have their own ranking called <a href="/hidden_novels{{ ext }}">Hidden Novels</a>.
