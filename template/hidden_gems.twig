        Top 250 highly rated games that few know but many love.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ranking uses a modified
        <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">Wilson score</a>
        to rank games. The current weighting heavily favours games with a high approval rating.
        Games ranked at the top will typically have an approval rating as close to 100% as possible.
        However, the score is negatively augmented by the number of players: once a game becomes too popular,
        its high player count will eventually sink it off the list.
        However, if it has has maintained its approval rating during its growth, it will typically reappear
        on one of the other rankings, such as the <a href="/">Top 250</a>, before this starts to happen.

    <p class="note">
        To make this list more useful we have chosen to exclude visual novels for the time being,
        because many are not available in English. Once we have a solution for language filtering,
        visual novels will return to this list. In the meantime, check out the dedicated
        <a href="/tag/visual_novel.html">visual novel ranking</a>. Thank you for your patience.
