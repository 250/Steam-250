    <s>This ranking only uses reviews submitted by Club 250 members. If you'd like your games featured here
    simply <a href="{{ patreon }}">join the club</a> for Â£5 or more and your reviews will be
    included automatically in the next update. If you're already a member, make sure your Steam account is
    linked to your Patreon account by following
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/16326842">these instructions</a>.</s>
</p>
<p>
    As of 28<sup>th</sup> July 2023, Patreon's API appears to no longer support linking your Patreon account to Steam.
    We are waiting to see if this issue is fixed, but if it is not, we will have to remove this feature.
    If that is the case, we will bring back an even better version where you will have your own private ranking just
    for your personal games collection, based on our scoring algorithm and/or your reviews.
</p>
<p class="note">
    Games with <em>only</em> negative votes are not included. If scores are tied, the global ranking is used as a
    tie-breaker.
